## Versions
The master design is `svg\logo.svg`.

The design is closely based on the logo in general use since 2004. 
The colours have been slightly adjusted to match the colour palette in-game in OpenTTD.
An alternative version with original colours is `svg\original_colours\logo_original_colours.svg`.
